		<h1>Smoking</h1>
		<p>Smoking affects the body in many ways. Smokers are at higher risk of lung cancer. Smoking damages the heart muscle and the blood vessels of the heart. Smoking even damages your eyes.</p>
		<p>The worst effect of smoking is that it damages the airways and gas exchange tissue of the lungs, making it harder to get enough oxygen. Airways become irritated so they secrete too much mucus which leads to coughing. The lung tissue breaks down and gets ‘floppy’. Smokers become breathless, and are at high risk of heart failure.</p>
